# Welcome Friends!

## Eyanna's HUMIS Homepage Repository

### I've learned many things from completing this project. Such as the different tags,
### the different sections, the differences between descendants and children, and
### much more!

### Working on this project has made me realize just how important it is to correctly
### label different code. This would definitely impact the organization of my future
### websites.
